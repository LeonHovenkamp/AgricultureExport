**Data and Code**

All data related to the GLORIA version 57 database were obtained through https://ielab.info/resources/datasets. The Matlab file (Step1) can be used to extract the Input Output matrices from the GLORIA database. The R and Matlab files (Step 2 & 3) can be used to generate the final demand vectors that include all Dutch agricultural export to final demand and other sectors outside the Netherlands. Matlab file (step 4) can be  used to generate material footprints for different environmental pressures and impacts related to Dutch agricultural export and file -step 5- can be used to create the value added matrix related to Dutch agricultural export. The R files -step 6, 7 & 8- include the postprocessing of the material footprints and the generation of the figures and tables as listed in the manuscript. 

'_Sectors_binary.csv_' encompasses the sectorial structure of GLORIA.57 and can be used in _step 2 & 3_ to select the different final demand vectors: plant-based export, animal-based export, total agricultural export and total export. Data on GDP per capita ('_GPD_per_capita.csv_') can be downloaded from the World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD). GDP per capita is used to generate Figure 3 and the multiple regression analysis (Step 8). The Global North country classification used in this study ('_Regions - Emerging non emerging.csv_')is based on a study from Hickel et al., (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2022.102467). The 27 European Union member states ('_EU_or_not.csv_') can be found on https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/eu-countries_en. Both the Global North country classification and the EU membership are used in the multiple regression analysis (Step 8).

Based on the technical documentation and release notes of GLORIA.57, data on smaller countries with smaller economies have higher uncertainties and are therefore excluded from our analysis. The technical documentation can be found at https://ielab.info/analyse/gloria.
